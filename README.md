The dataset was not appropriately cleaned so I took some steps in cleaning the dataset, some of the steps include:
- Remove or Correct the Blank First Row.
- Correct the Misaligned Headers.
- Handle the #NAME? Errors.
- Assess Missing Values
- Ensuring the data is allocated to it's appropriate data type.
- Check for Duplicate Rows by using the order id, as a check row.
- Create Derived Columns (e.g: month column, year column, and day column, for precise analysis)
